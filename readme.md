**Why did you choose this subject?**

* I have some friends that use it so I've always been curious about it. Also, from what I know I believe it's sort of(?) similar to React so I think it'd be cool to compare.

**How were you first made aware of it?**

* My friends + it's popular so I've heard of it before

**What problem does it solve?**

* Instead of having to use query selectors to update things in traditional javascript, it makes things responsive and dynamic

**How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?**

* Magic? I'm not really sure how to describe it haha

**Why does one use it?**

* Easy to get started with, small, there lots of resources available, let's you use HTML

**What are the alternatives?**

* React

**What is it similar to, if anything?**

* React

**What is the history of this technology?**

* It's fairly new -- it was initially released 4 years ago

**Who built it and why?**

* Evan You built it after working with Angular while working at Google and wanted a language that utilized the best parts of Angular to make it less dense

**Who is maintaining it?**

* He's still maintaining it

**What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?**

* I think it's really cool! It's similar to React, I'm not sure if there's something you can do in React that you can't do in Vue or if there's something you can do in Vue that you can't do in React. Since I'm don't have a complete understanding of either I can't really say which one is better.

**What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?**

* I don't think the concepts are super difficult since we've been working with components and state in React, it's just the code is written differently which was a bit confusing after switching from React

**What resources do you recommend for interested students?**

* [Vue documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)
* [Checkout the Vue — A Beginners Introduction to Vue.js](https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/checkout-the-vue-a-beginners-introduction-to-vue-js-a4c5a25a0cb9)
* [Angular vs. React vs. Vue: A 2017 comparison](https://medium.com/unicorn-supplies/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-a-2017-comparison-c5c52d620176)
* [Laracasts Tutorial](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step/)
* [Scotch.io Tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2)

**What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?**

* Definitely the Laracasts tutorial, it broke it down into really small pieces and kept building off of that. I'm definitely going to finish the tutorial in my free time because I think it's really interesting (even though I'm still wrapping my head around it)

**What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?**
